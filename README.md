# Tuxedo

Write UTXO-based Substrate Runtimes

## Scope

This repository will eventually contain the core of the Tuxedo toolkit for developing Substrate runtimes. At the moment it is more of a monorepo with a node template, a runtime, and the Tuxedo core.

## Under Development

Tuxedo's development is in its infancy. This repo is currently more of a playground than anything else. Stay tuned, or, better yet, contribute.
